# Banking-Analytics
A project where Im going to apply basic concepts about Data Analytics using Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) y Power BI, with real or simulated financial/consumption data to get initial insights.

## What do I do?
I analyze a dataset from kaggle which has data about sales in some countries, in differents types of store, getting insights in each process and confirming previus insights.
I use three differents tools, Excel, Python and Power BI, so this repository has four folders, data, excel, Python and  Power BI with his respective file or link to the file.
the dataset is on a drive which its links is on the markdown file in data folder, because the file i too big to storage in GitHub,
the excel file is on the same drive, but its link is in the excel folder on its markdown file.


## Excel
In this step, i red the data, using Power Query to transform de data, creating a table which helps to create dynamic tables and graphs to get the first insights.
### Insights that i've gotten after first analysis
* Dallas has the biggest amount
* the season that has the biggest amount by city depeneds of each city
* all seasons have the same percentage of Total Amount
* Atlanta and Seattle in spring have its biggest amount
* Boston, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles in Summer have its biggest amount
* Chicago and Miami in Winter have its biggest amount
* New York and San Francisco in Fall has its biggest amount
* Pharmacy is the store type which has the biggest Amount

## Python
In this step, I implemented pandas library to read and prepare the data storing in a dataframe, transforming it and having a data review.
i grouped the data in many ways and with matplotlib library, i got new insights and confirmed previus insights.
### Insights that i've gotten after second analysis
* Dalas is the city which has the biggest total amount
* Pharmacy is the store type which has the biggest total amount
* In each January the sales get down in comparison with other months

## Power BI
In this last step, I have created a dashboard, reading and transforming the data with Power Query (as excel), to visualize the insights that i got in the previus steps and get easier the story telling.
